1, I'm planing to create a shipment check list/todo app in the future.  
2, These code are just a mock.  
  
How to use.  
  
Download a Unshipped Order Report from Amazon Seller Central.  
Then run a python app.  
Select a report file you just downloaded.  
It looks like, "783748927483.txt"  
Then, Check dist folder. You can find your check list.  
Open with excel/spread-sheet/etc. and you can print it out.
