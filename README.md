### How to use  
  
Download a Unshipped Order Report from Amazon Seller Central.  
Then run a python app.  
Select a report file you just downloaded.  
It looks like, "783748927483.txt"  
Then, Check dist folder. You can find your CheckList or ClickPostData which has just created.  
Open it with Excel/SpreadSheet/etc. and you can print it out.  
  
### Upcoming  
I'm planing to create a shipment check list/todo app in the future.
